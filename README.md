This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to loose typing and unexpected comparison results. VBScript's dynamic typing system can lead to situations where comparisons between variables of different data types produce unexpected results. The provided code snippet shows an example of this, where string inputs are compared to numerical values leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution illustrates how to improve the function to handle string inputs correctly.
